## 🔧 **Quick Search Tips**

### **For Arabic/Islamic Apps:**
- Try searching in both Arabic and English
- Some apps might have different names in different regions
- Check if the app is available in your country

### **For Popular Apps:**
- Google Maps, WhatsApp, etc. are easy to find
- Use exact app names for best results
- Check developer names if multiple similar apps exist

### **For Lesser-Known Apps:**
- Try searching with additional keywords
- Check if the app has a website with store links
- Look for developer contact information

## 📝 **Updating the Files**

### **README.md:**
Replace placeholder URLs like:
```
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quransearch)
```
With actual URLs like:
```
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.actual.package.name)
```

### **index.html:**
Replace placeholder URLs in the href attributes with actual store URLs.

## 🚀 **Automated Approach (Optional)**

You could also create a simple script to:
1. Search Google Play Store API
2. Search Apple App Store API  
3. Automatically update the links

But manual verification is recommended for accuracy.

## ✅ **Verification Checklist**

After updating links:
- [ ] Test each link to ensure it opens the correct app
- [ ] Verify the app name matches what's listed
- [ ] Check if the app is still available
- [ ] Ensure links work in your target region

## 🌍 **Regional Considerations**

- Some apps may not be available in all countries
- App names might vary by region
- Store links might redirect based on location
- Consider adding region-specific notes if needed

**Remember:** The placeholder URLs in the current files are just examples. You'll need to replace them with the actual working links from the app stores.
